# Network Tools in Go

This project provides a collection of network tools implemented in Go (Golang) to simplify and enhance your networking tasks. It offers a set of powerful command-line utilities for performing various network operations, including traceroute, dig, and more.

### Features
Traceroute: Trace the path that network packets take from your machine to a target host, providing insights into network latency and routing information.

**Dig**: Perform DNS lookups and gather detailed information about domain names, IP addresses, mail servers, and more.

**Ping**: Send ICMP echo requests to a host to measure its responsiveness and estimate round-trip times.

**Port Scanner**: Scan a target host for open ports, allowing you to discover potential services and vulnerabilities.

**Whois**: Retrieve domain registration information, including registrant details, registration dates, and name servers.
